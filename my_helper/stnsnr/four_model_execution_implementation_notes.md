# Four-Model Execution Implementation Notes

This note records the first executable implementation layer for `four_model_execution_plan.md`.

The full four-model program is intentionally gated. The first code layer only implements M0 readiness checks and manifest generation. It does not run voxel or fiber statistics, does not compute E-field sidecars, and does not start formal permutation, bootstrap, jitter, OSS-DBS, or display stages.

## Implemented Layer

The M0 readiness entry point is:

```text
my_helper/fiber/stnsnr/run_stnsnr_four_model_m0_readiness.py
```

Reusable implementation lives in:

```text
my_helper/fiber/core/analysis/stnsnr_four_model_readiness.py
```

The pipeline script only resolves the repository path and calls the reusable core function. This preserves the rule that `my_helper/fiber/stnsnr` contains only orchestration scripts.

## M0 Scope

The readiness run verifies and records:

- Python execution environment, including the Conda `leaddbs` package versions needed for statistical post-processing.
- MATLAB executable availability and optional `ea_flip_lr_nonlinear` callability.
- `/Volumes/VAL/STNSNr` mount, `reference/`, `summary/`, and output-root writability.
- Raw clinical score workbook availability, required columns, subject count, default HF endpoint availability, ULF chronic delta/reconstructibility status, and immediate endpoint availability.
- `followup_stimulation.xlsx` `Contact Parameters` availability, required columns, subject count, target/frequency sanity, and expected MNI raw `sim-efield` path availability. Continuous stimulation uses the condition-level VTA folder. Alternating stimulation is discovered at subprogram/contact level with `alt_<side>_<target>_c<contact>_row*` folder names.
- Public connectome `data.mat` availability under the asset root.
- Connected-region atlas availability under the asset root.
- Scale direction table generation with `SE-ADL` marked higher-is-better and the current score scales marked lower-is-better.

The a409 worktree may not contain gitignored heavy assets such as `templates/` and `connectomes/`. The M0 tool therefore accepts an explicit `--asset-root` and otherwise falls back to `/Users/mojackhu/Github/leaddbs` when the current worktree lacks those assets.

## Outputs

Default output root:

```text
/Volumes/VAL/STNSNr/summary/four_model_execution/m0_readiness/
```

Each run writes a timestamped directory:

```text
run-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/
  four_model_m0_readiness_manifest.json
  four_model_m0_readiness_checks.csv
  four_model_m0_endpoint_availability.csv
  four_model_m0_efield_availability.csv
  scale_direction_table.csv
  environment/
    conda_leaddbs_explicit.txt
    pip_freeze.txt
```

The manifest records the overall status. Missing data are not silently ignored. The default run is report-only and exits `0`; `--strict` makes any `FAIL` check exit non-zero.

## M1 Shared Statistical Kernel

The first M1 code layer adds reusable statistical primitives only. It does not read real E-field matrices and does not write model outputs. The kernel is designed so the four model drivers can share the same exact baseline-adjusted partial Spearman, fold coverage, scoring, prediction, and permutation utilities.

Reusable implementation lives in:

```text
my_helper/fiber/core/analysis/stnsnr_four_model_stats.py
```

The smoke/equivalence self-test entry point is:

```text
my_helper/fiber/stnsnr/run_stnsnr_four_model_m1_selftest.py
```

The self-test verifies:

- vectorized partial Spearman matches a brute-force per-feature reference;
- LOOCV fold coverage by held-out subtraction matches a brute-force training-only coverage calculation;
- `HFScore_mean_main` style mean map scoring matches the manual formula;
- fiber `NetFiberScore = SweetPeak5 - SourPeak5` uses deterministic top-k selection and produces finite scores;
- Freedman-Lane permuted outcomes preserve the nuisance fitted component and are reproducible with seed `42`;
- plus-one two-sided permutation p values use the documented formula.

This layer is intentionally model-agnostic. It does not define HF/ULF paths, does not create sidecars, does not perform image/fiber sampling, and does not run formal `B=10000` loops.

## HF Direct Voxel Smoke Driver

The next executable layer implements the primary HF direct voxel observed branch only:

```text
model = HF direct voxel
scale = MDS-UPDRS III score (STN, 3 m) by default
branch = tau200 / partial_spearman
validation = observed LOOCV
resampling = not run
```

Entry point:

```text
my_helper/fiber/stnsnr/run_stnsnr_hf_direct_voxel_smoke.py
```

Reusable implementation:

```text
my_helper/fiber/core/analysis/stnsnr_hf_direct_voxel_smoke.py
```

This driver reads existing raw `sim-efield` files. It does not create missing e-fields. Alternating same-side subprograms are max-combined in the common right-canonical sampled feature space, which also handles the real case where subprogram local e-field grids differ. Left-side subprogram e-fields are flipped with `ea_flip_lr_nonlinear` into the right canonical space before sampling. The driver samples both right e-fields and left-to-right flipped e-fields on the right MNI brainmask grid, averages them per subject, builds `Candidate` from `180 V/m`, and runs the `tau200 / Coverage>=5` partial-Spearman observed LOOCV branch.

Because `ea_flip_lr_nonlinear` uses interpolation, a flipped E-field magnitude image can contain very small negative interpolation artifacts. The smoke driver clamps negative sampled E-field values to `0` and records the count and minimum value in QC. This is a numeric data-integrity correction for an E-field magnitude image, not a modeling threshold.

Outputs are written under:

```text
/Volumes/VAL/STNSNr/summary/direct_voxel/hf/<scale_slug>/
  preprocess/
  tau200/partial_spearman/
```

The smoke driver intentionally omits `direct_voxel_HF_permutation_summary.csv` and `direct_voxel_HF_bootstrap_se.nii.gz`; those belong to later gated formal/smoke resampling rounds.

## Commands

Run from the worktree:

```bash
/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda run -n leaddbs \
  python my_helper/fiber/stnsnr/run_stnsnr_four_model_m0_readiness.py \
  --run-matlab-check
```

Use `--strict` when M0 is acting as a hard gate before starting model computation.

Run the M1 shared-kernel self-test:

```bash
/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda run -n leaddbs \
  python my_helper/fiber/stnsnr/run_stnsnr_four_model_m1_selftest.py
```

Run the HF direct voxel observed smoke driver:

```bash
/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda run -n leaddbs \
  python my_helper/fiber/stnsnr/run_stnsnr_hf_direct_voxel_smoke.py
```
